## Introduction

Rate Your Music (RYM) is a popular platform where users can rate and review music albums, create lists, and discover new music. This scraper provides a convenient way to extract data from RYM without triggering anti-scraping mechanisms.

## Features

- Scrapes album information including title, artist, release date, genre, and user ratings.
- Handles anti-scraping measures to avoid detection.
- Saves scraped data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. The scraper will start collecting data from Rate Your Music based on your configured settings.
4. The scraped data will be saved in a CSV file (`data.csv` by default) in the root directory.

## How it Works

The scraper uses Selenium to mimic user interactions with the RYM website. It carefully navigates through the website, ensuring that scraping actions appear as legitimate as possible. Additionally, the scraper employs various techniques to avoid detection by anti-scraping mechanisms, such as randomizing request intervals, using user agents, and rotating IP addresses (optional).
